# RunAndGunFXGL

A Run and gun game like Contra made in FXGL but with gameplay concepts inspired by Doom.


## Controls

W and D for movement.

Space to jump. Double jump is also possible.

Aim with mouse and fire with primary button.

Q and E to change weapon when one has been picked up.

F to press switches.


## Running the game

The game is compiled in Java 11 so if you're using Java SE Runtime 8, the game can't be run.
I recommend downloading the latest SE JDK from here:

https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

After installing, the jar should run normally.
