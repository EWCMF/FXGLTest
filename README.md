# RunAndGunFXGL

A Run and gun game like Contra made in FXGL but with gameplay concepts inspired by Doom.

There are four difficulties that determine enemy damage. The hardest one also has no continues.
First time players are recommended to play on easy.


## Controls

W and D for movement.

Space to jump. Double jump is also possible.

Aim with mouse and fire with primary button.

Q and E to change weapon when one has been picked up.

F to press switches.


## Running the game

The jar for the game is found in the game folder in this repository.

The game is compiled in Java 11 so if you're using Java SE Runtime 8, the game can't be run.
I recommend downloading the latest SE JDK from here:

https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

After installing, the jar should run normally.
